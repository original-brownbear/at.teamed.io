## Ground Rules

{% par 1 %}
Any communications with programmers are prohibited,
outside of GitHub, including emails, phone calls, text messages,
Skype/Slack, IRC, etc.
Here is [why](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html).

{% par 2 %}
Write-access to the repository may be granted only to Rultor.
You should not give anyone else write-access to the repo.
Here is [why](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html).

{% par 3 %}
Technical suggestions and corrections, functional and non-functional requirements,
and other requests and complains about the product under development
must be submitted as GitHub tickets. Each ticket must be formatted as
a bug, expalining what is wrong now and what exactly is expected instead.
Here is [why](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html).

{% par 4 %}
In case of any conflicts or confusing situations in GitHub tickets,
post a message to the ticket, starting it with the name of project
superviser (usually it's `@yegor256`).

{% par 5 %}
Don't give instructions to project members in GitHub. Instead, specify
your technical requirements. How they satisfy them and when &mdash; is their business.
Be very demanding in technical aspect, but absolutely neutral in management aspect.
Here is [why](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html).
