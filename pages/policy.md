{% par 1 %}
When we start working with you, you'll get a few tasks in a few of our
[campus projects](/campus.html). They are paid, managed, and rated the same
way as all other tasks, but the projects are open source and hosted in GitHub.

{% par 2 %}
Once we see that you're capable of working on a commercial project,
we'll electronically sign a formal [contract](/engineer.pdf) with you and invite you to
a few commercial projects.

{% par 3 %}
We communicate with you via [Netbout.com](http://www.netbout.com). Please create
an account there and send your username to us by [email](mailto:dev@teamed.io).

{% par 4 %}
Project communications are kept solely in tickets. We don't use any other
communication tools, like emails, Skype, phone, conferences, or chats.
Read these articles:
[Five Principles of Bug Tracking](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html) and
[Stop Chatting, Start Coding](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html).

{% par 5 %}
Each task has a pre-defined budget, in minutes, which is announced by the project
manager. The budget is not negotiable. When the task is done,
you'll get a payment equal to the number of minutes in the budget multiplied
by your hourly rate, no matter how much time you actually spent on it.

{% par 6 %}
Our definition of done is simple: The task is done if
its author accepts the deliverables.
Read this article: [Definition of Done](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/definition-of-done.html).

{% par 7 %}
If you don't complete the task, you'll get no payment, no matter what
the reason for incompletion was, including someone else's mistakes.

{% par 8 %}
For a code review task, you'll get 15 minutes plus as many minutes
as the number of comments you post in the discussion. Whether you accept
the code or [reject](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/06/22/valid-reasons-to-reject-bug-fix.html)
it, you'll still get the payment.

{% par 9 %}
If you don't want to work with a task &mdash; for any reason, post a message
to the project manager asking to "_assign someone else._" In this case, you'll lose
as many points as there are minutes in the task budget.

{% par 23 %}
If you want to stop getting new tasks for a time, inform us
through Netbout, and you won't get any new assignments for any of our projects
during the desired period. Just post "_@alice away_" there.

{% par 10 %}
If you can't complete a task on time, inform the project manager about it. Just
post a message to him right in the ticket and ask for "_more time._" If he
accepts your request, you won't be penalized for any delays.

{% par 11 %}
If you can't complete a task on time because you're waiting for another
task to be completed first, inform the project manager. Post a message
to him right in the ticket, saying you are "_waiting for #123_"
(123 is the number of the ticket you're waiting on).
If he accepts your request, you won't be penalized for any delays.

{% par 12 %}
When you find a bug in existing source code or documentation, report it
[properly](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html),
and it is accepted by the project architect, you'll get 15 minutes added to
your account. Read this: [Bugs Are Welcome](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html).

{% par 13 %}
Small, easy-to-find, easy-to-fix, or cosmetic bugs and tasks are not paid,
even if they lead to a code change and project improvement. This
decision is made by a project architect and is not negotiable.

{% par 14 %}
When you close a task, we'll increase your rating by as many points as there
are minutes in the task budget.

{% par 15 %}
When you complete a task, we'll measure the speed of delivery, which is the
time interval between the moment you were informed of the task by the project manager
and the moment you were paid for its completion.

{% par 22 %}
If you complete a task in less than 24 hours, you'll get a 100 percent bonus on top
of the task's budget. If you complete it in less than 48 hours, you'll get a 50 percent bonus.
If you complete it in less than 72 hours, you'll get a 25 percent bonus.

{% par 31 %}
If you complete a task that has a boost factor attached to it, your
payment, together with the bonus, will be multiplied by that factor.

{% par 16 %}
You have 10 days to complete a task. If you fail,
no matter the reason, we'll assign the task to another
performer, and your rating will receive twice as many negative points as
there were minutes in the task budget.
Read this [No Obligations](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/13/no-obligations-principle.html) principle.

{% par 30 %}
If you hold a task for longer than seven days, you may get a notice from
a project manager and be docked points for your rating in the amount of the
minutes in the task budget.

{% par 17 %}
At any moment of time and at our own discretion, we may decide to stop
giving you tasks and remove you from any and/or all projects. This usually
happens for one of these reasons:
1) Your communication skills are poor;
2) Your rating is too low;
3) Your code quality is low.

{% par 18 %}
If you want to increase your hourly rate, send us a message via
[Netbout.com](http://www.netbout.com). There is no guarantee you will get
a raise, but these factors will be taken into account:
1) your rating, 2) your average speed of delivery, 3) your communication skills, and
4) the number of bugs you report. This article explains even more:
[How Hourly Rate Is Calculated](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/20/how-hourly-rate-is-calculated.html).

{% par 19 %}
All payment processing fees are reimbursed by us. No matter which payment
instrument is used (PayPal, Upwork, or Bitcoins), we guarantee
that you get exactly the amount you earned.

{% par 32 %}
There is a certain limit of tasks we'll assign to you concurrently. When
you start working with us, you'll have two tasks maximum. When
your rating is over 60, you'll get up to five tasks. When it's over 600, you'll get up to 10 tasks.
When it's over 1,600, you'll get up to 20 tasks.

## System Analyst (SA)

{% par 39 %}
As a system analyst, you are responsible for
[validation and verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation) of
product scope. First, you validate requirements to make sure the
specification is accurate. Second, you verify that our product is
in line with the specification. The specification (README file in GitHub)
is your deliverables. Follow these guidelines:
[How We Write a Product Vision](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/20/how-we-write-product-vision.html) and
[Worst Technical Specifications Have No Glossaries](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/03/16/technical-glossaries.html).

{% par 40 %}
You're allowed to communicate with the product owner via Skype,
Slack, phone calls, and emails. Communication with programmers still has
to go through GitHub tickets [only](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html).

{% par 41 %}
<del>Every time we pay for one hour to anyone in the project, you receive 10
minutes on your account.</del> (suspended)

{% par 42 %}
While the project is in [Thinking](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html#thinking)
phase, you're allowed to report any time spent. You will be paid
according to your reports. Just say "_I have spent 120 minutes for ..._"
to the project manager.

## Architect (ARC)

{% par 20 %}
For each release you publish as an architect, you'll get 30 minutes plus as many minutes
as [this formula](/release.html) calculates. A release is "published" when
its status in GitHub is set to "final." You have to ask the project owner to
change the status when a new version is released and it satisfies
the product owner.

{% par 21 %}
Each bug has to be accepted by an architect before it is paid and dispatched
for fixing. As an architect, when you see a new bug submitted, inform
the project manager that it is a valid bug by posting a message similar
to "_it is a valid bug,_" or explain to the reporter what is wrong with
the issue reported. Read this:
[Five Principles of Bug Tracking](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html).

{% par 26 %}
As an architect, you can prioritize tasks into three categories: urgent, normal,
and postponed. Urgent tasks are assigned to performers immediately. Normal
tasks are assigned to performers only when the project has fewer than 10
assigned tasks. Postponed tasks are never assigned. To change any task
priority, just ask a project manager with a statement like "_this task is urgent,_"
or "_this task is postponed,_" or "_this task is not urgent anymore._"

{% par 27 %}
As an architect, you can assign any ticket to one of the project milestones.
To do that, just ask a project manager to, for example, "_set milestone to 1.4._"

{% par 29 %}
As an architect, you can ask a project manager to assign any task to anyone;
just say, for example, "_assign @yegor256._"

{% par 28 %}
For each merged pull request, you'll get 10 minutes if the quality is "good,"
according to [QA](/qa.html). To motivate code reviewer to pay
more attention to details, you may ask QA to give "bad" quality to
the pull request. In this case, the reviewer will not be paid, while
you and QA will still be paid.

{% par 33 %}
Every few days, projects are checked by a project manager to detect
mistakes in ticket planning, milestone organization, release discipline, etc.
If any problems are found, you as an architect will get 25 points docked from your rating.
If no problems are found, you'll get 120 minutes. These rules are applied:
1) All tasks are dispatched within five days;
2) The latest release is either final or less than 10 days old;
3) There are no milestones missed for more than five days;
4) No tasks are stuck (in progress for more than 20 days);
5) There are fewer than six urgent tasks.

{% par 34 %}
As an architect, you'll get an extra 15 minutes for each bug reported,
on top of what you get according to &sect;12.

{% par 35 %}
You may be designated in Netbout as an interviewer when we
recruit new programmers. Apply your best judgement and try to
be objective, as [this article](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html)
suggests. When ready, post "_@alice verdict ..._" to the bout, explaining
your decision. No matter what your verdict is, you'll get 15 minutes.

{% par 36 %}
You may ask a project manager to mark any ticket as invalid or duplicate,
just say something like "_this is invalid_" or "_this is duplicate_".

{% par 37 %}
You can add a boost factor to any task, just ask a project manager
to do so, for example: "_boost factor is 2x_".

{% par 38 %}
While the project is in [Building](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html#building)
phase, you're allowed to report any time spent. You will be paid
according to your reports. Just say "_I have spent 120 minutes for ..._"
to the project manager.

## Quality Assurance (QA)

{% par 24 %}
As a QA engineer, you'll earn 10 minutes for each ticket reviewed according to
our [quality rules](/qa.html). You'll get
the payment right after you inform the project manager that the ticket
passed the review. Your message should include your measurement of the
quality, like "quality is good," "quality is acceptable," or "quality is bad."
No matter what remarks you make, you'll get paid right after you post it.

{% par 25 %}
A ticket performer will get his or her payment only after the ticket receives
your quality review. When you give a "good" mark, the performer gets a
bonus. If you give an "acceptable" mark, the performer doesn't get a bonus. When
you give a "bad" mark, the performer is not paid for the ticket.

on [Netbout.com](http://www.netbout.com). If you have a correction, please
submit a [pull request](https://github.com/teamed/teamed.io).
